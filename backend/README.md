# Branch Portal Backend

This is the Branch Portal's own backend — a fork of `uvactive-cloud-api`,
kept for this app only. Connects directly to the shared UV Active
Postgres database. Every business rule (suspension cascade,
capacity-safe booking, PIN generation, history retention,
consent-vs-override, anonymization) is enforced **here**, never
trusted to a client.

`SERVICE_SCOPE` defaults to `branch` in this fork (see
`src/config/configuration.ts`), so it only ever answers `/branch/*`
and `/auth/staff/*`. The `/admin/*`, `/trainer/*`, and `/member/*`
routes are still present in the source (kept identical to
`uvactive-cloud-api` and `uvactive-admin-panel/backend` on purpose, so
the three forks don't quietly drift), but this deployment 404s them —
the Admin Panel, Trainer App, and Member App each talk to a different
one of the other two.

Replaces the old `cloud-api/` mirror entirely. No hub, no per-gym local
SQLite fallback — this is the only source of truth.

**Stated assumption, flag if wrong:** the retain-forever vs.
data-erasure conflict is resolved as anonymize-on-request, never
hard-delete (see §"Anonymization" below). This is the engineering
default until legal counsel confirms a different requirement.

## Stack

- **NestJS + TypeScript**
- **PostgreSQL** via **Prisma** (schema + migrations)
- **Redis** (optional at MVP scale) for cross-instance rate limiting
- **argon2id** for PIN/password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken** — three separate signing secrets, one per auth realm
- **otplib** — TOTP for mandatory admin 2FA, plus 10 single-use backup codes
- **@nestjs/schedule** — cron jobs for notification retry, transfer-request expiry, and overdue-reassignment auto-cancel
- **Jest + Supertest** — real-database e2e tests for the concurrency-critical paths

## Local setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in DATABASE_URL and generate the three JWT secrets:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

docker compose up -d          # local Postgres + Redis
npm install
npm run prisma:migrate:dev    # creates the schema
npm run seed                  # creates the first super_admin (interactive prompt)
npm run start:dev
```

API docs (Swagger, non-production only): `http://localhost:8080/api/docs`
Health check: `GET /api/v1/health` → `{status, db, redis}`, 200 or 503 — checks both DB and Redis, not just DB.

## Global response envelope

Every response follows one of two shapes (spec §14):
```json
// success
{ "success": true, "data": {...}, "meta": { "skip": 0, "take": 50, "total": 123 } }
// error
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "SESSION_FULL", "message": "..." }, "path": "/api/v1/..." }
```
Clients match on `error.code`, never on message text. Spec-named codes
(`GYM_SUSPENDED`, `MEMBER_LIMIT_REACHED`, `PIN_LOCKED`, `SESSION_FULL`,
`TRANSFER_ALREADY_RESPONDED`) are thrown explicitly via `AppException`;
every other error falls back to a generic code derived from the HTTP
status (`NOT_FOUND`, `FORBIDDEN`, `CONFLICT`, etc.) so no response is
ever left without a matchable code. `meta` is only populated on the
paginated admin list endpoints (`/admin/members`, `/admin/sessions`,
`/admin/audit-log`) — other list endpoints return a bare array in `data`.
`/health` is deliberately excluded from this envelope — it's consumed
raw by the load balancer and uptime monitor.

## Auth realms

| Realm  | Login | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Member | `POST /auth/member/login` `{memberCode, pin}` — lockout after 5 fails / 15 min, keyed to memberCode not device | `POST /auth/member/pin/reset-request` `{memberCode}` → OTP to phone/email, then `POST /auth/member/pin/reset-confirm` `{memberCode, otp, newPin}`. If the member can't receive the OTP at all, recovery falls back to branch-triggered `POST /branch/members/:id/reset-pin`. |
| Staff  | `POST /auth/staff/login` `{email, password}` | `POST /auth/staff/forgot-password` `{email}` → 15-min single-use link, `POST /auth/staff/reset-password` `{token, newPassword}` |
| Admin  | `POST /auth/admin/login` `{email, password, totp}` or `{..., backupCode}` — TOTP mandatory | `POST /auth/admin/forgot-password`/`reset-password` (password only); `POST /auth/admin/2fa/setup` (returns secret + 10 backup codes, shown once) → `POST /auth/admin/2fa/confirm`; `POST /admin/admins/:id/reset-2fa` (super_admin resets a locked-out peer's 2FA); if a lone super_admin loses password + device + all backup codes, see `infra/BREAK_GLASS_RUNBOOK.md` — this is the one case nothing in the API can fix. |

All three: `POST /auth/refresh {realm, refreshToken}`, `POST /auth/logout {realm, refreshToken}`.
Refresh tokens are opaque, device-scoped, stored hashed — logout revokes exactly one device's session.

### The suspension cascade, concretely

`Gym.tokenVersion` is bumped on every suspend/reactivate. A staff access
token carries the version that was current at login. **Every**
authenticated staff request re-checks `gym.status === 'active'` and
`gym.tokenVersion === token.gymTokenVersion` in `GymActiveGuard` — so
suspending a gym invalidates every trainer's session on their *next
request*, not whenever their 15-minute token happens to expire. Covered
by `test/suspension-cascade.e2e-spec.ts`.

## Endpoint map

```

POST   /auth/member/pin/reset-request | reset-confirm
POST   /auth/staff/forgot-password | reset-password
POST   /auth/admin/forgot-password | reset-password
POST   /auth/admin/2fa/setup | 2fa/confirm
POST   /auth/refresh | logout

POST   /trainer/sessions/:id/start | end | cancel   (end is idempotent — safe to retry)
POST   /trainer/sessions/:id/readings    (optional raw BPM stream, additive only)

# Member realm
GET    /member/me             POST /member/change-pin
GET    /member/sessions       POST /member/sessions/:id/book       DELETE /member/sessions/:id/booking  (self-cancel, scheduled only)
GET    /member/transfer-requests
POST   /member/transfer-requests/:id/accept | decline
GET    /member/notifications  POST /member/notifications/:id/read
```

All routes are prefixed with `/api/v1` (see `main.ts`).

## Consent capture

`POST /branch/members` requires `consentVersion` (string) and
`consentAccepted` (boolean) — the registering staff member confirms the
member has been informed of and consents to data processing, logged
with a version + timestamp in the same transaction as the member row
(not a decorative checkbox — HR/biometric data is being collected).

## Anonymization (resolves retain-vs-erasure)

`POST /admin/members/:id/anonymize`, super_admin only, requires the
acting admin to re-enter their own password. Overwrites name/phone/
email/photo, clears the PIN (login disabled — effective account
closure), retains `member_code` and all `member_gym_history`/
`session_members` rows so other members' data and the gym's own
records stay intact. Distinct `audit_log` action
(`member.anonymize`) from a normal profile edit. **Confirm with legal
counsel this meets your actual regulatory obligation (India's DPDP
Act and/or GDPR if you expand) before launch** — this is the
engineering default, not a legal opinion.

## Session capacity engine — the concurrency-critical core

One shared function, `SessionsService.enrollMember()`, called
identically from branch/trainer/member routes. Implementation: a `SELECT
... FOR UPDATE` row lock on the parent `sessions` row inside the
transaction, THEN the count check, THEN the insert — this is what
actually prevents two *different* members from both winning the last
open seat under concurrent load. `UNIQUE(session_id, member_id)` is the
second line of defense, catching the same-member-twice case. Covered by
`test/capacity-race.e2e-spec.ts` (5 concurrent enrollments at capacity=1,
exactly one must win).

Cancellation: member self-cancel (`DELETE /member/sessions/:id/booking`,
only while `scheduled`), branch/trainer cancel-with-reason (notifies
every enrolled member), idempotent `POST .../end` (upsert keyed on
`(session_id, member_id)`, rejects results for anyone never enrolled or
a session never started).

## Trainer-suspension → session-reassignment cascade

Suspending a trainer (branch or admin-initiated) flags every one of
their still-`scheduled`, still-future sessions `needsReassignment=true`
and notifies the branch (`type: 'reassignment_needed'`) — surfaced via
`GET /branch/sessions?needsReassignment=true`, not a silent background
flag. Branch resolves it with `POST /branch/sessions/:id/reassign/:trainerId`
or an explicit cancel. A 10-minute cron (`SessionsReassignmentJob`)
auto-cancels anything still flagged past its own start time as the
fallback path, not the primary one. Covered by
`test/lifecycle-guards.e2e-spec.ts`.

## Testing

```bash
docker compose up -d   # test DB — point DATABASE_URL at a disposable database, never production
npm run test:e2e
```

Real integration tests against a real Postgres instance — deliberately,
because the row-lock and suspension-cascade behaviors are exactly the
kind of thing a mocked PrismaService would rubber-stamp without
exercising the actual transaction semantics. Covers the §17 checklist's
concurrency-sensitive items: capacity race, suspension mid-request,
idempotent session-end retry, gym-delete-blocked-while-assigned,
trainer-suspension reassignment flagging. **Not yet covered by
tests**: full backup-restore drill (must be a manual drill against your
actual managed Postgres instance, see below), booking-engine load test
at realistic peak, break-glass runbook dry-run.

## Deploying (Neon or DigitalOcean Managed Postgres + your own container host)

1. **Provision Postgres.** Neon or DigitalOcean Managed PG, enable
   automated backups + point-in-time recovery before go-live.
2. **Least-privilege DB roles.** Run `infra/db-grants.sql` once, as a
   superuser, after your first `prisma migrate deploy` — it creates
   `uvactive_migrator` (schema owner, CI/CD only) and `uvactive_app`
   (the role the running API connects as), and revokes UPDATE/DELETE on
   `audit_log` from `uvactive_app` specifically, so even a compromised
   app-layer bug can't rewrite history. **Re-run it after every
   migration that adds a table** — Prisma doesn't carry these grants
   forward on its own.
3. **Redis** (optional at launch, needed once you run >1 API instance) —
   a small managed instance. Set `REDIS_URL`.
4. **Container host** — DigitalOcean App Platform or a Droplet running
   the Dockerfile behind a load balancer. Stateless — scaling out is
   just adding replicas.
5. **Env vars** — everything in `.env.example`, set as platform env vars,
   never committed. Three JWT secrets must be distinct.
6. **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions: on merge to `main`, run `prisma migrate
   deploy` + `test:e2e` against staging, build the Docker image, deploy
   staging, manual promote to production.
7. **First super_admin** — `npm run seed` once, pointed at production
   `DATABASE_URL`, from a trusted operator's machine or a one-off CI job
   — never expose a "create first admin" HTTP route.
8. **Break-glass procedure** — read and staff `infra/BREAK_GLASS_RUNBOOK.md`
   *before* go-live, and dry-run it once against staging.
9. **Observability** — Sentry, structured JSON logs, uptime monitoring
   on `/api/v1/health` independent from the two web portals' own checks.

## What's deliberately NOT here yet (Phase 2+)

- **Realtime layer** (Socket.IO — live transfer-request push, optional
  live-session HR broadcast) — build as a separate `services/realtime`
  process. REST stays the source of truth; realtime is display-only.
- **BullMQ-backed notification/job queue** — the current
  `NotificationsService` writes-then-attempts-immediately with cron
  retries, which doesn't require Redis to run at all. Swap in a real
  BullMQ worker once volume justifies it.
- Read replica for admin analytics, billing hooks, CRM webhooks,
  GraphQL layer — explicitly not worth doing speculatively per the spec.
- Full backup-restore drill and realistic booking-engine load test —
  both need to happen against your actual managed Postgres instance,
  not this repo's test suite.
