/**
 * Every mutating action platform-wide gets written here — not just
 * Admin-initiated ones (Cloud API spec §3.9). Called explicitly from
 * each service right after its own mutation succeeds, rather than via a
 * generic interceptor, so the before/after diff that actually matters
 * (e.g. "released from gym X, reason Y") is meaningful instead of a raw
 * request/response dump.
 *
 * DB-level grants restricting this table to INSERT+SELECT for the app's
 * runtime role (no UPDATE/DELETE) are configured in infra — see
 * README's "Least-privilege DB role" section — so even a compromised
 * app-layer bug can't rewrite history.
